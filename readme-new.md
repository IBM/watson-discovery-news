# Query Watson Discovery News using the Watson Discovery service

In this code pattern, we build a Node.js web application that uses the Watson Discovery service to access Watson Discovery News.

Watson Discovery News is a default data collection that is associated with the Watson Discovery Service. It is a data set of primarily English language news sources that is updated continuously, with approximately 300,000 new articles and blogs added daily.

This code pattern demonstrates two use cases for accessing Watson Discovery News:

* **Trending Topics in the News**: Identify popular topics over the past 24 hours. Topics can be general, or for a specific industry or category.

* **Search**: Query for the most relevant new articles about a specific topic or subject. Results will include enrichment data, such as article summary text and sentiment analysis.

Optionally included will be examples of how to:

* Build a **RSS News Feed** generator to push trending news to your favorite RSS reader.

* Build a **SlackBot** to access the search feature from Slack.
